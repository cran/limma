for Microarray Data" and became part of the Bioconductor project.

11 November 2002: smawehi 0.1

smawehi package made publicly available for the first time, through
the repository http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/smawehi, for the One Day
Course "Statistics for Microarray Data Analysis" at the Australian
Genstat Conference, Perth, Australia, 2 December 2002.  This package
was intended to be used in conjunction with sma from UC Berkeley.

PRE-HISTORY

The limma package was originally called the smawehi package, which was
made public for the first time as SMAWEHI Version 0.1 for the One Day
Course "Statistics for Microarray Data Analysis" at the Australian
Genstat Conference, Perth, Australia, 2 December 2002.  Presenters
were Terry Speed, Gordon Smyth and Natalie Thorne.  The package was
served from an R repository at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au.  With
version 0.9.7 the package was renamed to 'limma' and became part of
the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org.
