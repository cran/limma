\title{Correct Intensities for Background}
\description{
Background correct microarray expression intensities.
}
\usage{
backgroundCorrect(RG, method="subtract", offset=0, printer=RG$printer, verbose=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{RG}{an \code{\link[limma:rglist]{RGList}} object or a unclassed list containing the same components as an \code{RGList}}
  \item{method}{character string specifying correction method.  Possible values are \code{"none"}, \code{"subtract"}, \code{"half"}, \code{"minimum"}, \code{"movingmin"}, \code{"edwards"} or \code{normexp}.}
  \item{offset}{numeric value to add to intensities}
  \item{printer}{a list containing printer layout information, see \code{\link{PrintLayout-class}}}
  \item{verbose}{logical, should progress be reported to standard output}
}
\details{
If \code{method="none"} then the corrected intensities are equal to the foreground intensities, i.e., the background intensities are treated as zero.
If \code{method="subtract"} then this function simply subtracts the background intensities from the foreground intensities which is the usual background correction method.
If \code{method="movingmin"} then the background estimates are replaced with the minimums of the backgrounds of the spot and its eight neighbors, i.e., the background is replaced by a moving minimum of 3x3 grids of spots.

The remaining methods are all designed to produce positive corrected intensities.
If \code{method="half"} then any intensity which is less than 0.5 after background subtraction is reset to be equal to 0.5.
If \code{method="minimum"} then any intensity which is zero or negative after background subtraction is set equal to half the minimum of the positive corrected intensities for that array.
If \code{method="edwards"} a log-linear interpolation method is used to adjust lower intensities as in Edwards (2003).
If \code{method="normexp"} a convolution of normal and exponential distributions is fitted to the foreground intensities using the background intensities as a covariate, and the expected signal given the observed foreground becomes the corrected intensity.
See \code{\link{normexp.fit}} for more details.
This results in a smooth monotonic transformation of the background subtracted intensities such that all the corrected intensities are positive.

The \code{offset} can be used to add a constant to the intensities before log-transforming, so that the log-ratios are shrunk towards zero at the lower intensities.
This may eliminate or reverse the usual 'fanning' of log-ratios at low intensities associated with local background subtraction.

Background correction (background subtraction) is also performed by the \code{\link{normalizeWithinArrays}} method for \code{RGList} objects, so it is not necessary to call \code{backgroundCorrect} directly unless one wants to use a method other than simple subtraction.
Calling \code{backgroundCorrect} before \code{normalizeWithinArrays} will over-ride the default background correction.
