\title{Table of Top Genes from Linear Model Fit}
\description{
Extract a table of the top-ranked genes from a linear model fit.
}
\usage{
topTable(fit,coef=1,number=10,genelist=NULL,adjust.method="BH",sort.by="B",resort.by=NULL)
toptable(fit,coef=1,number=10,genelist=NULL,A=NULL,eb=NULL,adjust.method="BH",sort.by="B",resort.by=NULL,...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fit}{list containing a linear model fit produced by \code{lmFit}, \code{lm.series}, \code{gls.series} or \code{mrlm}.
  For \code{topTable}, \code{fit} should be an object of class \code{MArrayLM} as produced by \code{lmFit}.}
  \item{coef}{column number or column name specifying which coefficient or contrast of the linear model is of interest}
  \item{number}{how many genes to pick out}
  \item{genelist}{data frame or character vector containing gene information.
  If not specified, this will be taken from the \code{genes} component of \code{fit}.}
  \item{A}{matrix of A-values or vector of average A-values.}
  \item{eb}{output list from \code{ebayes(fit)}}
  \item{adjust.method}{method used to adjust the p-values for multiple testing.  Options, in increasing conservatism, include \code{"none"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"} and \code{"holm"}.
  See \code{\link{p.adjust}} for the complete list of options. A \code{NULL} value will result in the default adjustment method, which is \code{"BH"}.}
  \item{sort.by}{character string specifying statistic to rank genes by.  Possibilities are \code{"M"}, \code{"A"}, \code{"T"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"P"}, \code{"p"} or \code{"B"}.}
  \item{resort.by}{character string specifying statistic to sort the selected genes by in the output data.frame.  Possibilities are \code{"M"}, \code{"A"}, \code{"T"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"P"}, \code{"p"} or \code{"B"}.}
  \item{...}{any other arguments are passed to \code{ebayes} if \code{eb} is \code{NULL}}
}
\value{
  A dataframe with a row for the \code{number} top genes and the following columns:
  \item{genelist}{if genelist was included as input}
  \item{M}{estimate of the effect or the contrast, on the log2 scale}
  \item{t}{moderated t-statistic}
  \item{P.Value}{adjusted p-value or q-value}
  \item{B}{log odds that the gene is differentially expressed}
}
\details{
This function summarizes a linear model fit object produced by \code{lmFit}, \code{lm.series}, \code{gls.series} or \code{mrlm} by selecting the top-ranked genes for any given contrast.
\code{topTable()} assumes that the linear model fit has already been processed by \code{eBayes()}.
Note that \code{toptable} is the earlier interface and is being phased out.

The p-values for the coefficient/contrast of interest are adjusted for multiple testing by a call to \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}.
The \code{"holm"} method is the default because it is conservative and valid for any type of dependence between the p-values.
In most microarray contexts however the less conservative Benjamini and Hochberg method \code{"fdr"} may be more suitable.
See \code{help("p.adjust")} for more information.
Note, if there is no good evidence for differential expression in the experiment, that it is quite possible for all the adjusted p-values to be large, even for all of them to be equal to one.
It is quite possible for all the adjusted p-values to be equal to one if the smallest p-value is no smaller than \code{1/ngenes} where \code{ngenes} is the number of genes with non-missing p-values.
Note that p-values adjusted to control the false discovery rate are often called q-values.

The \code{sort.by} argument specifies the criterion used to select the top genes.
The choices are: \code{"M"} to sort by the (absolute) coefficient representing the log-fold-change; \code{"A"} to sort by average expression level (over all arrays) in descending order; \code{"T"} or \code{"t"} for absolute t-statistic; \code{"P"} or \code{"p"} for p-values; or \code{"B"} for the \code{lods} or B-statistic.

Normally the genes appear in order of selection in the output table.
If one wants the table to be in a different order, the \code{resort.by} argument may be used.
For example, \code{topTable(fit, sort.by="B", resort.by="M")} selects the top genes according to log-odds of differential expression and then orders the resulting genes by log-ratio in decreasing order.
Or \code{topTable(fit, sort.by="M", resort.by="M")} would select the genes by absolute log-ratio and then sort then by signed log-ratio from must positive to most negative.
